Same goes for any errors related to this page.

# Interactive webpage

It is much more fun to see the data in interactive plots:

<a href="https://dustbringer.github.io/web--knot-invariant-comparison">Click</a>

On that side one can find statistics, roots plots and ballmapper plots.

# Jave script for B1 computation

TO BE DONE

# Data files

On this webpage one can find the list of knots, the list of calculated invariants, a few statistics (as in the paper) and colors for the ballmapper.

All can be downloaded above. Since the files are fairly large, they are compressed to .7z files and can be easily extracted.

# How we calculated everything

The main calculations ran on the Katana cluster of UNSW.

<a href="https://docs.restech.unsw.edu.au/using_katana/about_katana/">Click</a>

It took about 4 month to complete, with almost all of the time needed for the B1 invariant.

### Katana Cluster Overview

Katana is a shared computational cluster located at UNSW, designed for non-sensitive data research. It provides easy access to computational resources for projects that exceed the capabilities of desktop or laptop systems. Below is an overview of its features and configuration.

Key Features:
- **Over 6,000 CPU cores** across heterogeneous hardware (Dell, Lenovo, Huawei).
- **8 GPU Compute Nodes**:
  - Tesla V100-SXM2, 32GB.
  - Nvidia A100, 40GB.
  - Five nodes are department-dedicated, while three are for general use.
- **6 PB of Disk Storage**.
- Flexible compute environment supporting jobs with long walltime limits:
  - 12, 48, 100, 200-hour queues with prioritization.
- Training and support are available for new users or researchers uncertain about using High-Performance Computing (HPC).

System Configuration:
- **OS**: RPM-based Linux (Rocky 8 on management plane and nodes).
- **Scheduler**: OpenPBS version 23.06.06.
- **Scratch Storage**:
  - Global scratch at `/srv/scratch`.
  - Local scratch available at `$TMPDIR`.

Compute Resources:
- **Roughly 170 nodes**:
  - Heterogeneous CPU configurations for diverse compute needs.

GPU Compute:
- **Eight GPU Nodes**:
  - High-memory GPUs (V100-SXM2 and A100).
  - Dedicated and general-use configurations for flexibility.

Advanced Use:
Katana serves as a training or development base before transitioning to systems like Australiaâ€™s peak HPC system, Gadi at NCI. Research Technology Services provide guidance and training for effective use of HPC resources.
